This is a project to make a ruby on rails webpage showing information about melakarta ragas and janya ragas that I put in a table using sqlite.
I first put my information in two tables and used a foriegn key to link them.
Next, I decided I wanted to display all of my information on a website.
I then started using ruby on rails.Following the tutorial, i designed a page that displayed my information and also linked the information I put in my tables out on the page.
The following info in this project is how I did that.
